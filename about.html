            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I’m Elliot Currie — a Mechanical Engineering graduate turned Automation & Internal Tools Developer, currently solving problems for a national estate agency group's contact centre department. My title might say “Data Engineer,” but the reality is a bit grittier: I operate in restricted environments, with no access to official APIs or modern infrastructure, yet I consistently build systems that automate, inform, and drive impact.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                I specialize in making things work when they technically shouldn’t. Using a combination of <strong>Excel, Python, Power Platform, SharePoint, PostgreSQL</strong>, I’ve turned what used to be manual, painful processes into fully automated systems — from <strong>lead generation and call log tracking</strong> to <strong>real-time gamification engines</strong> that drive performance in a competitive contact centre.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                I’ve developed tools like:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-1 mt-2">
                <li>Scrapers generating 2,000+ landlord leads per month</li>
                <li>An internal lead management platform built on Power Apps and SharePoint</li>
                <li>Real-time call data pipelines using Playwright and a portable PostgreSQL DB</li>
                <li>PTD League — a gamified competition system with sabotage, H2H battles, and season-based promotion</li>
                <li>Call transcription and voicemail detection pipelines using Whisper and signal analysis</li>
                <li>Custom dashboards and automated reports sent via HTML email and Teams</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                I got into this by asking, “why are we still doing this manually?” — and then solving it myself. Over time, I’ve become the person people go to when something’s broken, inefficient, or just plain boring. I’m known for delivering before the official teams even get out of planning.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
                While my background is in engineering, what I really enjoy is <strong>building systems that scale</strong>, <strong>connecting data that isn’t meant to be connected</strong>, and turning technical debt into opportunity — without waiting on permission.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6 italic">
                I build things that people actually use. And when I’m done automating the work, I use the time I’ve gained to build something even better.
            </p>
